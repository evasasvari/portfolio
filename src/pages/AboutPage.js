                            My name is Ã‰va SasvÃ¡ri. I am 21 years old Multimedia Design student based in Aarhus, Denmark. Iâ€™m from Hungary, but I always loved to travel and get to know more about the world and that is the reason I decided to study abroad. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Iâ€™m specializing in frontend development, but I also have interest in UX/UI and working on visuals. I believe developing and teaching ourselves is the key to an interesting and colourful life. I love to challenge myself and solve problems in the most creative and efficient way possible.
                        </p>
